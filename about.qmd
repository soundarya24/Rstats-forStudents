About this site


This is a website to introduce RStudio and its power to my students

You can do simple things like:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Or more complex things like:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(
  mtcars,
  aes(x = mpg, y = hp)
) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```

Come, let's learn R together!
