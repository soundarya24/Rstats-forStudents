Rstudio makes codes much easier and hence it is very useful to write codes there as a beginner. I know you want to know how.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow how RStudio makes your job easier\n\n\n\n\nRStudio has inbuilt prompts that helps you finish the codes. You can imagine it like your mobile which suggests the word as you type.\nIt also has a console where you can run the codes and see the output.\nIt also has a file explorer, a plot window, a help window and a package manager.\n\nAll these makes it much easier for beginner to learn in RStudio.\n\n\nOnce you installed R and RStudio, you are free to work on RStudio even without opening R. Open it to familiarize with its interface."

You have successfully run your first code in RStudio. You can also run the code by writing them first as a script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, I am not a coder!\n\n\n\nThis is a common feeling when we start with R, particularly if we are not used to programming. Even I was not a programmer when i started learning R.\n\n\n\nRead about curbing this feeling"

Broadly for a beginner, you can do the following:\n\nData analysis\nData visualization\nReport writing\n\nYou can pick any of the above and start learning or mix and match them as you learn, like I did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to aim if I am a total beginner\n\n\n\nI would suggest data visualization as it is rewarding. If you are here because your project required a particular analyses, then you might want to begin there. Report writing may require skills of 1 and 2 and maybe prioritized down the line."

You can do this by following the best practices. I have these following suggesstions for you to begin with.\n\nWriting scripts: Write your codes in a script file and run them in the console. This way you can keep track of your codes and run them whenever you want. Read about writing scripts in RStudio here.\nProjects: Create a project in RStudio for each of your work. This way you can keep all the files related to a project in one place. Read about creating projects in RStudio here.\nImporting data: Import your data into RStudio using the readr package. Read about importing data in RStudio here.\n\nClick here to know more about the best practices in R.\n\n\n\nMy tweet for beginners on best practices"

    "text": "6 What are packages?\nPackages are the building blocks of R. They are the collection of functions, data and documentation in R. You can think of them as the apps in your mobile. You can install them from the CRAN repository and use them in your codes. How to install them is described later.\nYou may have to install the package you want only once, but load them every time you start a new session. I would think this as electricity and using fans/lights at home. When you build a new home, you have to install the electricity connection only once, but you have to switch on the fans/lights every time you use them. Installing packages is like installing the electricity connection and loading them is like switching on the fans/lights.\n\n\n\nLoad the packages like you switch on the fan every time you need\n\n\nYou can install and load a package using the following code: install.packages(\"package_name\") and library(package_name) respectively.\nI highly suggest you start with the tidyverse package. It is a collection of packages that are designed to work together. You can install and load the tidyverse package using the following code: install.packages(\"tidyverse\") and library(tidyverse) respectively. Learn more about the tidyverse package here."

This will help you recreate your error and share it with others to get help."
